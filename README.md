# plg_workflow_webhook
Developed for a talk at Joomla Day USA.  This plugin adds Webhooks to the transition config for workflows.  As we all know with webhooks you can do almost anything.

The premise of the talk was to focus people not on what workflows can do now but what we can make it do tomorrow.  Not sure the talk accomplished that but maybe this plugin did.

The plugin was devloped under time pressure, by all means use now to test but come back soon for a newer improved version.
